# Week 1

### Exam Tips #1
Read through the exam guide outline.

The outline communicates how an authority thinks about and organizes the skills required of a Professional Data Engineer.

Training tends to be organized in a ramp; basic concepts first, building into more complex and difficult concepts later. The Exam Guide is not training. So it is not organized for learning, or by importance, or by process. It is organized according to how a group of experts thinks about the job.

There is no additional information about what any particular line means; no explanation.

#### TIP - Use the Exam Guide outline to help identify what to study.
The recommendation is for you to read through each line and think about what it actually means, what do you think it is saying about the job? Then ask yourself if you understand that aspect of the job and if you feel you have the skills required to be successful in that part of the job. If yes -- great. It is an indicator that you are prepared. If no -- take note. You may want to study additionally in that part or develop specific skills for that item in the Exam Guide.


### Quiz: Module 1 Assessment
**1. Question 1**

The Certification Exam is:

- [ ] Theoretical, based only on information.
- [x] Practical, based on the skills required of the job.

**2. Question 2**

This course helps you prepare using:

- [ ] Exhaustive lists of essential concepts (bottom-up), and practice quizzes to help you memorize the majority of the concepts.


**3. Question 3**

The recommended test-taking strategy is:

- [x] Bookmark those questions for which you don't know the answer or don't feel confident in your answer, and return to them iteratively.
- [ ] Answer each question in order and ignore the bookmarking feature.

### Exam Tips #2
Product  and technology knowledge
You need to know the basic information about each product that might be covered on the exam. 

#### You need to know:
What it does, why it exists.

What is special about its design, for what purpose or purposes was it optimized?

When do you use it, and what are the limits or bounds when it is time to consider an alternative?

What are the key features of this product or technology?

Is there an Open Source alternative? If so, what are the key benefits of the cloud-based service over the Open Source software?

#### Which products and technologies
Training and Certification meet at the JTA -- the Job Task Analysis -- the skills required of the job.

The scope of the exam matches the learning track and specialization in training. So a great place to derive a list of the technologies and products that might be on the exam is to look at all the products and technologies that are covered in the related training. The training might not cover everything. But it is a good place to start.

#### Study methods
Training is great. Digging into the online documentation can be very instructive and covers more detail than can be covered in a class, so documentation tends to have more equal coverage of features, whereas training has to prioritize its time. Getting hands on experience can help you understand a product or technology much better than reading and is the kind of experience a professional in the job would have. So labs can be a great way to prepare.
