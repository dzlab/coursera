# Lab: BigQuery in Jupyter Labs on AI Platform

## Overview
The purpose of this lab is to show learners how to instantiate a Jupyter notebook running on Google Cloud Platform's AI Platform service. To aid in the demonstration, a dataset with various flight departure and arrival times will be leveraged.

### Objectives
In this lab, you learn to perform the following tasks:

- Instantiate a Jupyter notebook on AI Platform.
- Execute a BigQuery query from within a Jupyter notebook and process the output using Pandas.
