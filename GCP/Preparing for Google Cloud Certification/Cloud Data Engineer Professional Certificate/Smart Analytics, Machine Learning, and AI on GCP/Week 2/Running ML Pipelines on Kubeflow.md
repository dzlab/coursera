# Lab: Running ML Pipelines on Kubeflow

## Overview
In this lab, you learn how to configure and create an AI Platform Pipelines instance. After you configure the AI Platform Pipelines instance, you run an example pipeline and visualize the pipeline graph to see the different metrics, logs, and parameters that are available.

## Objectives
In this lab, you perform the following tasks:

- Create a Kubernetes cluster and configure AI Platform pipelines
- Launch pipelines dashboard
- Create and run an experiment from an example end-to-end ML Pipeline
- Examine and verify the output of each step
- Inspect the pipeline graph, various metrics, logs, charts and parameters
