## Overview
In this lab, you deploy an application to App Engine and then create alerting policies to notify you if the application is not accessible or is generating errors.

### Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Download a sample app from GitHub.

- Deploy an application to App Engine.

- Create uptime checks and alerts.

- Create an alerting policy with the CLI.

## Task 1: Download and test a sample app from GitHub
1. Switch to the Cloud Shell window.

2. Clone the Google Training Data Analyst from GitHub into your Cloud Shell environment. The repo contains a simple application which is perfect for the requirements in this exercise.
```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst.git
```

3. Once the cloning completes, change to the deploying-apps-to-gcp folder in the repository that contains our sample app.
```
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/design-process/deploying-apps-to-gcp
```

4. Open the `main.py` file in the Cloud Shell editor. If prompted click Open in a new window. Take a moment to explore the basic "Hello GCP" Python Flask application.
```
edit main.py
```

5. Close the editor and switch back to the Cloud Shell terminal. Click Open terminal at the top right to open the Terminal window. To test the program, load all of the Python application dependencies and then start the app.
```
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

6. To see the program running, click the Web Preview button in the toolbar of Cloud Shell, and then select Preview on port 8080.

7. The program should open a new browser tab and display the Hello GCP message. Close the tab and switch back to Cloud Shell, then press CTRL+C to exit the running Flask server.

## Task 2: Deploy an application to App Engine
Now that we know the application works, let's deploy it to the App Engine.

1. Switch to (or reopen) the Cloud Shell code editor. Expand the `training-data-analyst/courses/design-process/deploying-apps-to-gcp` folder in the explorer tree on the left.

2. From the File menu, select New File and name the file `app.yaml`.

3. Paste the following into the file you just created.
```
runtime: python37
```

4. To make sure the file is saved, select File | Save.

5. Every project needs to first create an App Engine application before it can be used. This is done just once per project using the Console, or the gcloud app create command. Either way, you need to specify the region where you want the app to be created. Execute the following command in your Cloud Shell terminal. You may have to Authorize Cloud Shell to make such a change:
```
gcloud app create --region=us-central
```

6. Deploy the basic application to App Engine. The following command looks in the current directory for the application. It sees the app.yaml file declaring it a Python application and it assumes the rest of the folder contains the application itself, with a starting point in main.py. It loads the dependencies, packages the application, and deploys into the App Engine as a Service.
```
gcloud app deploy --version=one --quiet
```

7. Wait for the application to finish deploying, then in the Google Cloud Console window, use the Navigation menu (console_nav_small.png) to navigate to App Engine | Dashboard.

8. In the upper right of the dashboard, you see a link to your application similar to what is shown below.

> Note: By default, the URL to an App Engine is the form of https://project-id.appspot.com.

9. Click the link to test your newly deployed app. It should function exactly like it did when we ran it in Cloud Shell.

10. Click refresh a number of times so Google Cloud can gather some sample data.

## Task 3: Examine the App Engine Logs
1. Switch back to the Console and on the left side under App Engine, click the Versions link.

2. Open the Tools dropdown in the Diagnose column of the table and then select Logs.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1645304/174932761-0f846db9-80e0-416d-baf4-fc333b4d1e94.png)

3. In the logs, you see the requests you just made. If you get here too fast, wait a few seconds and click the Jump to Now button.

## Task 4: Create an App Engine latency alert
Now that we have the application running, let's create an alert to watch for unusually high latency. To start, let's explore our application's current latency.

### Check current application latency in Metrics explorer
1. In the Google Cloud Console, use the Navigation menu to navigate to Monitoring | Metrics explorer. Because this is the first time accessing a monitoring related page, wait for Google Cloud to create the Monitoring Workspace.

2. Set the Resource & Metric to GAE Application -> Popular Metrics -> Response latency. Click Apply. Make sure the metric is an App Engine metric, and not an uptime check metric. Because we don't currently have an uptime check, the second option won't work.

3. Change the Aggregator to mean.

4. Show Advanced Options and set the Aligner to 99th percentile.

5. Take a moment and examine the chart. We don't have a lot of data but we should have enough to display a chart line showing us the average time it took our application to return a response to the fastest 99% of requests, cutting off 1% of anomalies.

### Create an alert based on the same metric
Our application is performing as expected now. There may have been a few slow responses when the application was first launched, but on average, you should be seeing response times under 200ms.

Let's create an alert to notify us if we have response times over 5s for more than a minute.

1. Use the Navigation menu to navigate to **Monitoring | Alerting**.

2. At the top, click Edit Notification Channels and scroll to the Email section. Use Add New to add your email address as a valid notification channel. For Display name , choose any name and then click SAVE.

3. Switch back to the main Alerting page and click Create Policy.

4. Click Select a metric to display the same metric explorer page. Once again, set the Resource & Metric to GAE Application > Http > Response latency. Click Apply and then click Next.

5. You'll notice the new Configuration section that's been added to the standard Metrics explorer window in the lower left. Set up a condition so that if Any time series violates the Condition is above a Threshold of 8000ms, it should trigger an alert.

6. Set the condition name to **Response latency \[MEAN\] for 99th% over 8s**.

7. Take a moment to examine the alert's chart. It's the same chart we created earlier with the Metrics explorer, but this time there should be an alert line drawn at 8s.

8. Click Next.

9. For Notifications and name, expand the Notification Channel and check yourself, click OK (the notification channel you created earlier in this section).

10. Name the alert Hello too slow and click Next. Review alert and click Create Policy.

11. Update the application code to add a delay. Return to the Cloud Shell code editor. Expand the training-data-analyst/courses/design-process/deploying-apps-to-gcp folder in the explorer tree on the left.

12. Click `main.py` to open it in the editor. Near the top at line 2, add the following imports statements (some will be used later in the exercise):
```python
import time
import random
import json
```

13. Replace the current `main()` function with the one below. This new version adds a sleep command which pauses the code for 10s in the middle of each request. This will be well over the threshold.
```python
@app.route("/")
def main():
    model = {"title": "Hello GCP."}
    time.sleep(10)
    return render_template('index.html', model=model)
```

14. Now re-deploy your application by rerunning:
```
gcloud app deploy --version=two --quiet
```

15. Wait for the command to finish the re-deployment.

16. After the command completes, return to the App Engine | Dashboard and make sure the link works.

17. To generate some consistent load, in Cloud Shell, enter the following command:
```
while true; do curl -s https://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com/ | grep -e "<title>" -e "error";sleep .$[( $RANDOM % 10 )]s;done
```

> Note: This command makes requests to the App Engine app continuously in a loop. The grep command will display the title of the page when the request works. It also displays the error, if it doesnâ€™t work. Every iteration, the thread sleeps a random amount of time less than a second, but with the 10s response time delay it will seem much longer.

18. Wait and after a few minutes (typically about 5), you should receive an email notifying you of the alert. When you do, switch back to the Cloud Shell terminal and use CTRL+C to stop the load tester loop.

19. Use the Navigation menu to view the Monitoring | Alerting page in the Google Cloud Console.

20. Notice the firing alert and how it created an incident. Click the incident to view details.

21. Investigate the details page, then scroll to the bottom and add a comment. Finally, scroll to the top and select Acknowledge Incident.

22. Switch back to the main Alerting page and notice the changes.

## Task 5: Creating an Alerting Policy with the CLI
The Alerting CLI (and API) can be very effective when applying alerting policies with code or scripts.

1. Return to the Cloud Shell code editor. Select the training-data-analyst/courses/design-process/deploying-apps-to-gcp folder in the explorer tree on the left.

2. From the File menu, select New File and name the file app-engine-error-percent-policy.json.

3. Create an alerting policy which divides the number of 500 errors by the total number of responses, then triggers when the 500 errors exceed 1 percent. Paste the following into the file you just created:
```json
{
    "displayName": "HTTP error count exceeds 1 percent for App Engine apps",
    "combiner": "OR",
    "conditions": [
        {
            "displayName": "Ratio: HTTP 500s error-response counts / All HTTP response counts",
            "conditionThreshold": {
                 "filter": "metric.label.response_code>=\"500\" AND
                            metric.label.response_code<\"600\" AND
                            metric.type=\"appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_count\" AND
                            resource.type=\"gae_app\"",
                 "aggregations": [
                    {
                        "alignmentPeriod": "60s",
                        "crossSeriesReducer": "REDUCE_SUM",
                        "groupByFields": [
                          "project",
                          "resource.label.module_id",
                          "resource.label.version_id"
                        ],
                        "perSeriesAligner": "ALIGN_DELTA"
                    }
                ],
                "denominatorFilter": "metric.type=\"appengine.googleapis.com/http/server/response_count\" AND
                                      resource.type=\"gae_app\"",
                "denominatorAggregations": [
                   {
                      "alignmentPeriod": "60s",
                      "crossSeriesReducer": "REDUCE_SUM",
                      "groupByFields": [
                        "project",
                        "resource.label.module_id",
                        "resource.label.version_id"
                       ],
                      "perSeriesAligner": "ALIGN_DELTA",
                    }
                ],
                "comparison": "COMPARISON_GT",
                "thresholdValue": 0.01,
                "duration": "0s",
                "trigger": {
                    "count": 1
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

4. Save your file. Make sure you are in the correct folder and that your alerting policy was saved there.
```
cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/design-process/deploying-apps-to-gcp
ls
```

5. Deploy the alerting policy with the following command:
```
gcloud alpha monitoring policies create --policy-from-file="app-engine-error-percent-policy.json"
```

6. Back in the Google Cloud Console, return to the **Monitoring | Alerting** page. In the Policies section, you should see the alerting policy you just deployed.

7. Click your HTTP errorâ€¦ policy to see its details. Edit the notification channel so you receive an email when the alert fires.

8. Deploy the App Engine app with a random error to test this policy. Return to the Cloud Shell code editor. Expand the training-data-analyst/courses/design-process/deploying-apps-to-gcp folder in the explorer tree on the left.

9. Open the `main.py` file in the Cloud Shell editor.

10. Replace the current `main()` function with the one below. This new function removes our sleep command and uses the random number generator to return a 500 error about 2% of the time. This should be enough to cause your HTTP error count policy to trigger.
```python
@app.route("/")
def main():
    num = random.randrange(49)
    if num == 0:
        return json.dumps({"error": 'Error thrown randomly'}), 500
    else:
        model = {"title": "Hello GCP."}
        return render_template('index.html', model=model)
```

11. Redeploy your application with the following command:
```
gcloud app deploy --version=two --quiet
```

12. Wait for the command to finish the redeployment.

13. After the command completes, return to the **App Engine | Dashboard** and make sure the link works.

14. In Cloud Shell, rerun the load generator command from earlier.
```
while true; do curl -s https://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com/ | grep -e "<title>" -e "error";sleep .$[( $RANDOM % 10 )]s;done
```

15. In Cloud Shell, you should see an error appear randomly about 2% of the time. Leave the command running. In the Console, go to Monitoring | Alerting, wait another few minutes, and then you should see an alerting incident fire. You should also get an email. This wonâ€™t happen immediately, you have to be patient.

16. Once you get the email and see the incident fire, go back to Cloud Shell and press CTRL+C to stop the requests.

17. If you wait a couple more minutes, you see the incident resolve itself and get another email.

18. To make sure you donâ€™t get any emails after the project is deleted, delete your notification channels. Click the HTTP error countâ€¦ policy to see its details. Click the Edit link, expand the Notification Channel and uncheck yourself. Toggle off Use notification channel. Save your changes and then Delete the policy.

19. Repeat the previous step to your Uptime check alerting policy.

## Review
> Congratulations!

In this exercise, you used the Google Cloud Console and CLI to create and test alerting policies. Good job!
