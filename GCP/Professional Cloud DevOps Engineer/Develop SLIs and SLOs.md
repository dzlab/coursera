Source: https://googlecoursera.qwiklabs.com/focuses/22275779?parent=lti_session

## Overview
In this exercise, you follow the process used on the User Profile journey to develop Service Level Indiactors (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the Buy In-Game Currency journey.

## Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Study the Buy In-Game Currency user journey.

- Design a set of SLIs and SLOs.

## Task 0. Getting ready
If you are attending an in-person, instructor-led event, please take a moment to form into teams of approximately 4 people. If you are attending virtually, please do the exercise on your own.

## Task 1. Study the Buy In-Game Currency user journey
Take a moment and review the `Buy In-Game Currency user` journey.

### Buy In-Game Currency

Our most important user journey is the one that generates all our revenue: users buying in-game currency via in-app purchases. Requests to the Play Store are only visible from the client. We see between 0.1 and 1 completed purchase every second; this spikes to 10 purchases per second after the release of a new area as players try to meet its requirements.

1. Have someone on your team create a copy of the following file and share it with the rest of the team: [SLO Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cT-6wmlojuppOhJ02QPBN9w-XkXcLctQkwANOwt5peg/edit).

2. As a team, use the worksheet and plan at least one SLI/SLO. Feel free to do more if you have the time. Be prepared to present your ideas to the class.

## Review
Congratulations!

You successfully planned SLIs and SLOs.
