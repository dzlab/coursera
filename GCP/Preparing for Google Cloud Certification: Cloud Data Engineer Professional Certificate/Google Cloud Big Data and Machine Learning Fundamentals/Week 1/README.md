# Week 1

## Lab: Exploring a BigQuery Public Dataset
In this lab, you will explore publicly available datasets using BigQuery for big data analysis. Specifically you will:

- Query a public dataset
- Create a custom table
- Load data into a table
- Query a table


### Reading: Google Cloud Public Datasets program
Google Cloud hosts over 150+ public datasets in BigQuery for exploration and use in applications

Take 5-10 minutes and read about the [program here](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/public_datasets_one_pager.pdf) and then continue with your first lab which will be exploring a public dataset in BigQuery

- [x] Analyzing large datasets at scale
- [ ] Building containerized applications for web development
- [ ] Building streaming data pipelines
- [x] Applying machine learning to your datasets


**2. Question 2**

You have a large enterprise that will likely have many teams using their own Google Cloud Platform projects and resources. What should you be sure to have to help manage and administer these resources? (check all that apply)

- [x] A defined Organization
- [x] Foldersfor teams and/or products
- [x] A defined access control policy with Cloud IAM
- [ ] A Kubernetes or Hadoop cluster for each project


**3. Question 3**

Which of the following is **NOT** one of the advantages of Google Cloud security

- [x] Google Cloud will automatically manage and curate your content and access policies to be safe for the public
- [ ] Google Cloud will secure the physical hardware that is running your applications and infrastructure
- [ ] Google Cloud has tools like Cloud IAM that help you administer and set company-wide security policies
- [ ] Google Cloud will manage audit logging of access and use of resources in your account


**4. Question 4**

If you don't have a large dataset of your own but still want to practice writing queries and building pipelines on Google Cloud Platform, what should you do?

- [x] Practice with the datasets in the Google Cloud Public Datasets program
- [x] Find other public datasets online and upload them into BigQuery
- [x] Work to create your own dataset and then upload it into BigQuery for analysis


**5. Question 5**

As you saw in the demo, Compute Engine nodes on GCP are:

- [x] Allocated on demand, and you pay for the time that they are up.
- [ ] Expensive to create and teardown
- [ ] One of ~50 choices in terms of CPU and memory
- [ ] Pre-installed with all the software packages you might ever need.
