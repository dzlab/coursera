# Chapter 10 Choosing Training and Serving Infrastructure

## Edge Computing with GCP

### Cloud IoT
Cloud IoT is Googleâ€™s managed service for IoT services. The platform provides services for integrating edge computing with centralized processing services. Device data is captured by the Cloud IoT Core service, which can then publish the data to Cloud Pub/Sub for stream- ing analytics. Data can also be stored in BigQuery for analysis or used for training new machine learning models in Cloud ML. Data provided through Cloud IoT can also be used to trigger Cloud Functions and associated workflows.
Figure 10.3 shows the reference architecture for Cloud IoT.
The reference architecture for Cloud IoT includes the following:
- Cloud IoT Core for device management
- Cloud ML Engine for training and deploying machine learning models Cloud Dataflow for streaming and batch analytics
- Cloud Pub/Sub for ingestion
- BigQuery for data warehousing and ad hoc querying
- Other GCP services can be used as well, including Cloud Storage for archival storage and Cloud Firestore for storing semi-structured data that will be queried.
