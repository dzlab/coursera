In Cloud Storage, which storage class is ideal for files you access rarely, as in once every five years?
- [ ] Standard
- [ ] Nearline
- [ ] Coldline
- [x] Archive

**Explanation**

One of the great things about it is that it has multiple storage classes: Standard, Nearline, Coldline, and Archive. Standard is for frequently accessed files. Nearline is for files you expect to access only about once a month or less. The advantage is that it costs less than Standard as long as you don’t access it frequently. Coldline is for files you expect to access at most once every three months. Archive is for files you expect to access less than once a year. It has the lowest cost.

All four storage classes give you immediate access to your files. This is different from some other cloud providers where the lowest cost storage can take hours to access.

Which GCP NoSQL database service is ideal for use with client-side web and mobile apps?
- [x] Cloud Firestore
- [ ] Cloud Bigtable
- [ ] Cloud Memorystore
- [ ] Firebase Realtime Database

**Explanation**
Google offers many NoSQL databases, including Bigtable, Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, and Memorystore. Bigtable is best for running large analytical workloads. Firestore is ideal for building client-side mobile and web applications. Firebase Realtime Database is best for syncing data between users in real time, such as for collaboration apps. Memorystore is an in-memory datastore that’s typically used to speed up applications by caching frequently requested data.

Each GCP region includes at least how many zones?
- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
- [x] 3
- [ ] 4

**Explanation**

A region is basically a data center. Each region contains at least three zones. A zone is essentially an independent part of a data center and has its own power, cooling, network, and security infrastructure. Google divides its data centers into at least three independent zones so that if one of them goes down, it won’t affect the other zones. So, if you distribute your resources across the zones, your applications will keep running even if one of the zones fails.

**#10**
Which command-line tool available within Cloud SDK can manage all GCP services except for Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Kubernetes?

- [x] gcloud
- [ ] bq
- [ ] gsutil
- [ ] kubectl

**Explanation**

The SDK includes two types of tools. The first is what you’d expect in an SDK: a collection of client libraries that your applications can use to interact with GCP services.

The second is a set of command-line tools, including gcloud, gsutil, bq, and kubectl. The one you’ll use the most is gcloud, which is for managing all services other than Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Kubernetes.
