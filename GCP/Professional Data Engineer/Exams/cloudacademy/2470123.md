Which methods can be used to reduce the number of rows processed by BigQuery?
- [ ] Putting data in partitions; using the LIMIT clause
- [ ] Splitting tables into multiple tables; using the LIMIT clause
- [ ] Splitting tables into multiple tables; putting data in partitions; using the LIMIT clause
- [x] Splitting tables into multiple tables; putting data in partitions

**Explanation**

If you split a table into multiple tables (such as one table for each day), then you can limit your query to the data in specific tables (such as for particular days). A better method is to use a partitioned table, as long as your data can be separated by the day.

If you use the LIMIT clause, BigQuery will still process the entire table.

What Dataflow concept determines when a Window's contents should be output based on certain criteria being met?
- [x] Triggers
- [ ] Sessions
- [ ] Windows
- [ ] OutputCriteria

**Explanation**

Triggers control when the elements for a specific key and window are output. As elements arrive, they are put into one or more windows by a Window transform and its associated WindowFn, and then passed to the associated Trigger to determine if the Windows contents should be output.
