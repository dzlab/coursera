### AppEngine

### Compute Engine
- Managed Instance Group https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-managed-instances#monitoring_groups

### Cloud Functions
- Run your code in the cloud with no servers or containers to manage. Cloud Functions is a scalable, pay-as-you-go functions as a service (FaaS) product to help you build and connect event driven services with simple, single purpose code.
- Cloud Functions is event-driven and is not meant for long-running tasks.

https://cloud.google.com/functions

### Cloud Tasks
- Distributed task queues
- Cloud Tasks is a fully managed service that allows you to manage the execution, dispatch, and delivery of a large number of distributed tasks. Using Cloud Tasks, you can perform work asynchronously outside of a user or service-to-service request.


https://cloud.google.com/tasks

### Cloud Scheduler
Cloud Scheduler is a fully managed enterprise-grade cron job scheduler. It allows you to schedule virtually any job, including batch, big data jobs, cloud infrastructure operations, and more. You can automate everything, including retries in case of failure to reduce manual toil and intervention. Cloud Scheduler even acts as a single pane of glass, allowing you to manage all your automation tasks from one place.

https://cloud.google.com/scheduler

### Cloud Run
Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables you to run containers that are invocable via requests or events. Cloud Run is serverless: it abstracts away all infrastructure management, so you can focus on what matters most â€” building great applications.

### Cloud Build
With Cloud Build, continuously build, test, and deploy software across all languages and in multiple environments

- https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/configure-build-step-order
- https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/configuring-builds/create-basic-configuration
- https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-config
- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/continuous-delivery/

#### Good to know
There is a persistent file system that is shared between steps in a Cloud Build. We change the story to be:
1. Deploy the Cloud Function.
2. Save the results of calling the Cloud Function to a file.
3. Delete the Cloud Function.
4. Test the content of the file.
Since step 2 can now never fail, step 3 is executed and step 4 defines the outcome of the build as a whole.

### Cloud Debugger

- https://cloud.google.com/debugger/docs/source-options#github

### Cloud Compute
- https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/creating-groups-of-managed-instances#monitoring_groups

### BigQuery
BigQuery is a data warehouse. It has limited update/delete capabilities for inserted rows and hence is a bad choice for user session data, which changes as the session with the user progresses.
- https://cloud.google.com/solutions/building-scalable-web-apps-with-cloud-datastore
- https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-firestore

#### Syntax
- JOIN types https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#join_types

| Join | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
|[INNER] JOIN | An INNER JOIN, or simply JOIN, effectively calculates the Cartesian product of the two from_items and discards all rows that do not meet the join condition.| `FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.w = B.y` |
| CROSS JOIN | returns the Cartesian product of the two from_items. In other words, it combines each row from the first from_item with each row from the second from_item.| `FROM A CROSS JOIN B` |
| FULL [OUTER] JOIN | A FULL OUTER JOIN (or simply FULL JOIN) returns all fields for all rows in both from_items that meet the join condition.| `FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.w = B.y`|
| LEFT [OUTER] JOIN | A LEFT OUTER JOIN (or simply LEFT JOIN) for two from_items always retains all rows of the left from_item in the JOIN operation, even if no rows in the right from_item satisfy the join predicate. | `FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.w = B.y` |
| RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN | A RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or simply RIGHT JOIN) is similar and symmetric to that of LEFT OUTER JOIN. | `FROM A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B ON A.w = B.y` |

Migration types [https://cloud.google.com/architecture/migration-to-gcp-getting-started]

- Lift and shift: you move workloads from a source environment to a target environment with minor or no modifications or refactoring.
- Improve and move: modernize the workload while migrating it.
- Remove and replace (or rip and replace): you decommission an existing app and completely redesign and rewrite it as a cloud-native app.

Migration tools
- [Kf](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/kf/docs/2.9/getting-started) offers developers the Cloud Foundry experience while empowering operators to adopt declarative Kubernetes practice. It makes migrating Cloud Foundry workloads to Kubernetes straightforward, and most importantly, avoids major changes to developer workflows.

### Cloud Storage

- https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=0&dest=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Fstorage%2Fdocs%2Fstorage-classes%23standard-availability

Storage classes for any workload
Save costs without sacrificing performance by storing data across different storage classes. You can start with a class that matches your current use, then reconfigure for cost savings.

|Class | Storage Cost | Access Frequency | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
|Standard | High | Access data frequently | Hot or Frequently accessed data: websites, streaming videos, and mobile apps.|
|Nearline | Low | Access data only once a month | Data stored for at least 30 days, including data backup and long-tail multimedia content.|
|Coldline | Very low | Access data only once a year. | Data stored for at least 90 days, including disaster recovery.|
|Archive | Lowest | | Data stored for at least 365 days, including regulatory archives.|
| Multi-Regional Storage| High | Access data frequently | Equivalent to Standard Storage, except it can only be used for objects stored in multi-regions or dual-regions. |


### BigTable
Bigtable is a NoSQL DB is more performant and stores data in a unique way which can help with time-series data (such as Financial market data).

- https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/schema-design-time-series#ensure_that_your_row_key_avoids_hotspotting

### Firestore
Firestore in Native mode is recommended for storing user-session information and is a natural choice for this test.
- https://cloud.google.com/architecture/building-scalable-web-apps-with-cloud-datastore

### Memorystore
Memorystore is an in-memory database not suitable for data analysis.

### Logging
- Setup https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/agent/installation
- Quotas https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas

#### Audit
| Log Type | Description | Documentation |
| - | - | - |
| Admin activity| show destroy, create, modify, etc. events for a VM instance. | [link](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/#admin-activity) |
| Data access| Show read activities. | [link](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/#data-access)
| Syslog | A service running in systemd that outputs to stdout will have logs in syslog and will be scraped by the logging agent. | [link](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fluentd-catch-all-config/tree/master/configs/config.d) |
| System event| Tell you about live migration, etc. | [link](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/#system-event)|
| VPC flow logs | uses the substrate specific logging to capture everything. | [link](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-flow-logs) [course](https://cloudacademy.com/course/implementing-a-gcp-virtual-private-cloud-1224/vpc-flow-logs/)

#### Export
Logging retains app and audit logs for a limited period of time. You might need to retain logs for longer periods to meet compliance obligations. Alternatively, you might want to keep logs for historical analysis.

You can route logs to Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Pub/Sub. Using filters, you can include or exclude resources from the export. For example, you can export all Compute Engine logs but exclude high-volume logs from Cloud Load Balancing.

### Permission
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/enterprise/best-practices-for-enterprise-organizations

- A general recommendation is to have one project per application per environment.
- We recommend collecting users with the same responsibilities into groups and assigning IAM roles to the groups rather than to individual users. 
- We recommend that you use service accounts for server-to-server interactions.
